# ESLint Auto-fix Rule

Always use `npm run lint:fix` when possible to automatically fix linting errors before manual fixes.

## Priority Order:
1. **First**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix as many errors as possible
2. **Then**: Manually fix remaining errors that cannot be auto-fixed
3. **Finally**: Run `npm run lint` to verify all issues are resolved

## Common Auto-fixable Issues:
- Indentation (tabs vs spaces)
- Line endings (CRLF vs LF)
- Quote styles (single vs double)
- Semicolons
- Spacing issues
- Template literal spacing

## Manual Fixes Required:
- `no-shadow` errors (rename conflicting variables)
- `no-use-before-define` errors (reorder function definitions)
- `eqeqeq` errors (replace == with ===, != with !==)
- `no-var` errors (replace var with const/let)
- `max-statements-per-line` errors (split multi-statement lines)
- `no-return-assign` errors (refactor arrow functions)

Always prefer tabs over spaces for indentation as per project convention.
